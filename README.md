In the course of this project, I developed a streaming service with real-time lexical censorship using machine learning technologies. The following tasks were completed:

Analyzed existing streaming platforms.
Designed and implemented the server-side component.
Designed and implemented the client-side interface.
Built a lexical censorship module using neural networks.
Conducted system testing.
As a result, a fully functional streaming service was created, capable of filtering sensitive vocabulary in real time. The system successfully handles streaming content and applies basic censorship to maintain appropriate language standards.
